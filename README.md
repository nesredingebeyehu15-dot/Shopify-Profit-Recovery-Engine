# Shopify Profit Recovery Engine 🚀
**By Nesredin Gebeyehu** | *Shopify Supply Chain Specialist*

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This engine is a high-performance diagnostic tool designed to identify **Cash Leaks** in Shopify stores. While standard dashboards show "what" happened, this system uses Python to explain **"why"** profit is leaking and **"how"** to recover it through data-driven inventory and sales analysis.

## 📈 Business Impact & Profit Recovery Focus
- **Refund Leakage Audit:** Identifying high-return products that destroy net margins.
- **Inventory Velocity:** Spotting "Dead Stock" to free up tied-up capital.
- **Landed Cost Accuracy:** Calculating true product profitability beyond simple COGS.
- **Stockout Prevention:** Using data to ensure high-margin items never go out of stock.

## 🏗 Project Architecture
The system is built with a modular, industry-standard structure for maximum scalability:
- `data/`: Multi-tier storage for Raw (Immutable), Processed, and External datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prototype logic for profit auditing.
- `src/`: Core Python logic for margin calculation and inventory optimization.
- `docs/`: Professional audit reports and financial summaries for stakeholders.
- `tests/`: Automated scripts to verify the accuracy of financial calculations. 
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Data Engine:** Pandas & NumPy (Optimized for 100k+ rows)
- **Visualization:** Plotly (Interactive Financial Dashboards)
- **Deployment:** Streamlit
