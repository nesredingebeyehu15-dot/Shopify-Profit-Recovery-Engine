# Shopify Profit Recovery Engine 🚀
**By Nesredin Gebeyehu** | *Shopify Supply Chain Specialist*

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This engine is a high-performance diagnostic tool designed to identify **Cash Leaks** in Shopify stores. While standard dashboards show "what" happened, this system uses Python to explain **"why"** profit is leaking and **"how"** to recover it through data-driven inventory and sales analysis.
